# Two Pointers | Local Optimization | Comments | ChatGPT 4 | Xms

# Intuition

We're working with two sides of an array, suggesting two pointers.

We're looking to return a maximum area, suggesting local optimization as a possible approach.

# Approach

Use a two-pointers approach.

Initialize the left pointer to zero.

Initialize the right pointer to the end of the height list.

Loop through:

* Calculate the width based on index values of the left and right pointers.
* Calculate the height based on the value in the height array at the left and right index. Select the minimum.
* Calculate the current area. Select the maximum area as compared to previous areas.
* Increment the left pointer if the height value is less than the right height value. We're looking for the maximum. So, we're looking to increase the smaller value. 
* Increment the right pointer if the height value is less than the left height value. We're looking for the maximum. So, we're looking to increase the smaller value. 

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of the `height` list.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - A constant number of supporting variables.

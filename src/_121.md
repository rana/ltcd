# Intuition

This involves finding some sort of ascending relationship between the buy and the sell. Buy low, sell high.

# Approach

Iterate through each price going left to right.

Each day we either:
* Set or update the minimum price.
* Set or update the maximum  profit.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of the `prices` array.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - Allocates two integer variables.

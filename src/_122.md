# Intuition

Can try a simple approach of buying and selling at the first profit.

Only look at local optimization, "greedy".

# Approach

Loop through all the prices.

Compare today to yesterday.

Is there a profit? If so, buy and sell and record the profit.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of the `prices` array.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - Allocates one integer variable.

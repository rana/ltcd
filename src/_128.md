# Intuition

The challenge is the O(n) time complexity constraint.

Use a HashSet and look for sequences.

# Approach

Create a HashSet with all numbers in it.

Loop through each number.

Check for the start of a sequence. The start of a sequence is defined by `current number - 1` not being in the set.

If a sequence is starting, see how long the sequence is. Track the maximum length.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
    - We iterate through the nums array twice. Once to insert into the array, and once to look for sequences.
- Space complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
    - We populate a HashSet with each element from `nums`.

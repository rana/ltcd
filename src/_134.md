# Intuition

We need to look at whether the gas and cost can traverse the entire route.

Also look at the segment between one gas station and the next for a starting station.

# Approach

Track the total fuel.

Track the fuel from a starting station. Start at index `0`.

Check whether the fuel from the starting station can make it to the next station.

If no, set the next station as a potential starting station.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of `gas` and `cost` arrays.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - A constant number of supporting variables.

# Intuition

Rely on a library function to check string prefixes.

Compare prefixes from one string to all other strings.

# Approach

Use vertical scanning.

Compare the first string's characters to all other strings.

If it's the prefix, stop early.

Otherwise, remove the last character from the current prefix.

Vertical scan all other strings.

Repeat until solution, or not found.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(S)`
    - `S` is the sum of the lengths of all strings in `strs` array.
- Space complexity: `O(m)`
    - `m` is the length of the first string.

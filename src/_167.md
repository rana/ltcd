# Two Pointers | Comments | ChatGPT 4 | 0ms

# Intuition

Given a sorted array, we can use the sort to efficiently find a solution.

# Approach

Use the two-pointer technique.

One pointer starts at the front of the array.

One pointer starts at the back of the array.

Compare the back element + front element to the target element.

If its equal, the solution is found, return.

If its less, advance to the next back element, which is larger.

If its greater, advance to the next front element, which is smaller.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - A constant number of supporting variables.

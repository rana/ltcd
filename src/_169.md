# Boyer-Moore Voting | Comments | 0ms

# Intuition

Majority element occurs at least half the length of `nums` times.

Majority element finding is efficiently found with the Boyer-Moore Voting algorithm.

# Approach

Start with a `candidate` variable and a counting variable.

Loop through all the numbers.

When the count is zero, set a new candidate.

If the count isn't zero, compare the current number to the candidate. 

If the current number is equal to the candidate, increment the count; otherwise, decrement the count.

At the end of the loop, the candidate is set and found.

Return the majority element.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
  - `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
  - Allocates a couple integer variables.

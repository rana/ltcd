# Intuition

Write code which applies the next number rules.

Use a cycle detection approach to determine a solution.

# Approach

Write a function which return the next number according to the rules.

Use Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm to detect a loop or solution.

Call the function once for a slow path.

Call the function twice for a fast path.

Return true if the fast path equals one. A solution is found.

Return false if the slow path equals the fast path. A cycle is found. 

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(logn)`
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - A constant number of variables.

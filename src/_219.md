# HashMap | Comments | ChatGPT 4 | 10ms

# Intuition

Notice that the array isn't sorted.

A non-sorted array suggests using a HashMap.

# Approach

Create a HashMap.

Loop through each element of `nums`.

Check whether the current number has a stored duplicate in the HashMap.

If so, check for the success condition of `i-j <= k`. 

Return true if condition met.

If no duplicate, insert number to index mapping in the HashMap.

After the loop, no success condition was found; return false.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
- Space complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
    - `n-1` elements may be stored in the HashMap.

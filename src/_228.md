# Two Pointers | Comments | ChatGPT 4 | 0ms

# Intuition

Search for contiguous ranges with two indexes.

# Approach

Create a return vector.

Create an outer while loop and an inner while loop.

The outer while loop is conditioned on the right pointer.

The inner while loop attempts to grow the interval range from the left pointer to the right pointer.

Store the result of the current range evaluation.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - n is the length os the nums array.
    - Looks through each element of the nums array.
- Space complexity: `O(n)`
    - n is the length os the nums array.
    - Can store each element of the nums array when there is no contiguous sequence.

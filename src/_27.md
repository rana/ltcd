# Two Pointers | Comments | 0ms

# Intuition

Notice that we have a single array that's not sorted.

Objective is to move non-`val` elements to the front of the array.

Compare each array element to `val`. Comparison is done with two elements. Comparison can be done with two pointers.

Move each non-`val` element to the front of array `nums`. Move an element from a source index to a destination index. Two pointers can be used for the source index and destination index.

A two pointer approach can be used.

# Approach

Initialize two pointers to the front of the array. Initialize `lft` to index zero. Initialize `rht` to index zero.

Search for an element on the right side that can move left; that is an element not equal to `val`.

If we find a movable element, move it to the `lft` pointer position.

Don't be concerned for the element at the `rht` pointer position.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
  - `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
  - Allocates a couple integer variables.

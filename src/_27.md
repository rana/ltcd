# Two Pointers | Comments | 0ms

# Intuition

Notice that we have a single array.

Objective is to move non-`val` elements to the front of the array.

Compare each array element to `val`. Comparison is done with two elements. Comparison can be done with two pointers.

Move each non-`val` element to the front of array `nums`. Move an element from a source index to a destination index. Two pointers can be used for the source index and destination index.

A two pointer approach might be used.

# Approach

Initialize two pointers to the front of the array. Initialize `lft` to index zero. Initialize `rht` to index zero.

Search for an element on the right side that can move left; that is an element not equal to `val`.

If we find a movable element, move it to the `lft` pointer position.

Don't be concerned for the element at the `rht` pointer position.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
  - Where `n` is the length of the array `nums`.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
  - Constant space. 
  - Only allocates a few supporting integer variables.

# Metrics

Measured in CPU cycles.

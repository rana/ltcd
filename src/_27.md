# Two Pointers | Comments | 0ms

# Intuition

Notice that we have a single array.

Objective is to move non-`val` elements to the front of the array.

Compare each array element to `val`. Comparison is done with two elements. Comparison can be done with two pointers.

Move each non-`val` element to the front of array `nums`. Move an element from a source index to a destination index. Two pointers can be used for the source index and destination index.

A two pointer approach might be used.

# Approach

Initialize two pointers, `lft` and `rht`, to the front of the array.

Search for an element not equal to `val` with the `rht` pointer.

When we find a non-`val` element, move it to the `lft` pointer position.

Don't be concerned for the value at the `rht` pointer.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
  - Where `n` is the length of the array `nums`.
  - We iterate through the array once.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
  - Constant space. 
  - Only allocates a few supporting integer variables.

# Metrics

Measured in CPU cycles.

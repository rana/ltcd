# Intuition

We need to keep track of the index position of each character.

# Approach

Use a HashMap to store the last position of a character. This allows us to skip repeating characters. Since the constraint is to use simple English characters, we can map the character digit value to an array, for an efficient hashing function. See [ASCII digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) to verify the length of the array.

Loop through each character in string `s`.

Lookup the last position of the current character.

Calculate the length of the current substring.

Store the current length if it's longer than any previous substring.

Update the position of the current character.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of string `s`.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - A constant number of supporting variables.

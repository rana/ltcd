# Intuition

Use arrays of sets to track Sudoku validity for each column, row and box.

# Approach

Traverse each column and row.

Insert each digit into a column set, row set, and box set.

If any set already contains the digit, return false.

Return true, if the traversal of all columns and rows completes.

# Complexity

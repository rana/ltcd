# Intuition

Count character frequencies in each string using HashMaps.

# Approach

Create a ransom note HashMap.

Count the character frequencies in the ransom note.

Create a magazine HashMap.

Count the character frequencies in the magazine.

Compare the frequencies of each character of the ransom note and magazine.

If a magazine character frequency is less than a ransom note character frequency, return false; otherwise, return true.

Since characters are lowercase English letters, we can create a HashMap from an array with a perfect hash function by subtracting the first letter `a`.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n + m)`
    - `n` is the length of string `ransomNote`.
    - `m` is the length of string `magazine`.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - A constant amount of space due to the constraint of `<= 26` English letters being used.

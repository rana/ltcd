# Intuition

Can use a local optimization "greedy" approach.

# Approach

Loop through each number.

Track the next maximum jump.

Each time the next maximum jump is reached, increment a counter.

Return the counter.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - Allocates several integer variables.

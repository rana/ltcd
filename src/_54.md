# Intuition

Cycle through the row-column indexes based on the spiral.

# Approach

Create left and right index bounds for row traversal.

Create top and bottom index bounds for column traversal.

Iterate until complete:
 * Loop on the current top row.
 * Loop on the current right column.
 * Loop on the current bottom row.
 * Loop on the current left row.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(m)`
    - `m` is the number of matrix elements.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - A constant number of supporting variables.

# Intuition

Could approach it with dynamic programming top-down and bottom-up.

Can approach it with local optimization "greedy".

Notice that having reached a particular index we can determine failure.

Or, can determine the next possible reachable index.

# Approach

Use local optimization "greedy" approach.

Loop through each number.

Track the maximum reachable index.

Is the current index beyond the maximum reachable? Then return `false`.

Update the maximum reachable index with the current value.

If we reach the last index, then return `true`.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - Allocates a few integer variables.

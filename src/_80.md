# Two Pointers | Comments | ChatGPT 4 | 0ms

# Intuition

Notice that we have a sorted array `nums`.

Objective is to remove duplicates above a count of `2`.

Move the final solution to the front of the array.

Do the work in-place.

Return the length of the solution array.

# Approach

Two-pointer technique.

Be aware of the maximum number of duplicates `2`.

Left pointer is slow mover. Right pointer is fast mover.

Move pointers from left to right.

Compare the current right element to the left element two indexes back. If right element is greater, move right element to the left element.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
  - `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
  - Allocates an integer constant and integer variable.

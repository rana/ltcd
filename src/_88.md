# Two Pointers | Comments | 0ms

# Intuition

Notice that the two arrays are already sorted.

Rely on the existing sorting to merge.

Two arrays suggests two pointers.

# Approach

Merge arrays.

Arrays are sorted in ascending order.

Start from the end of each array.

End elements will be the largest.

Insert the larger of the two elements first.

Insert the larger of the two elements at the end of the target array.

Check for the decrement boundry condition while using `usize`. Use the `wrapping_sub` function to decrement from zero to `usize::MAX`. Use the presence of any `usize::MAX` as an exit boundry condition.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(|nums1| + |nums2|)`
    - `|nums1|` is the length of list `nums1`.
    - `|nums2|` is the length of list `nums2`.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - Constant space is provided by `nums1`.

# Metrics

Measured in CPU cycles.

Equivalent. Prefer `b`; easier to read.

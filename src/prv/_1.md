# Intuition

Use a HashMap and search for a number complement.

# Approach

Create a HashMap.

Map number to index.

Loop through each number.

Calculate the complement of `target - current number`.

Lookup complement in HashMap:
- If exists, return solution.
- If not exists, store map of number to index.

After loop, no two numbers exist; return an empty list.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
    - We loop through each number.
- Space complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
    - Up to n-1 numbers may be stored in the HashMap.

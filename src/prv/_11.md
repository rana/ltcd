# Two Pointers | Local Optimization | Comments | ChatGPT 4 | 0ms

# Intuition

We're working with two sides of an array for a square area calculation. That suggests using two pointers.

We're looking to return a maximum area, suggesting local optimization "greedy" as a possible approach.

# Approach

Use a two-pointers approach and local optimization.

Initialize the left pointer to zero.

Initialize the right pointer to the end of the height list.

Loop through the `height` array:

* Calculate the width based on indexes themselves.
* Calculate the height based on the value in the array. Use the left and right indexes. Select the minimum height due to the concept of a water container.
* Calculate the area during the current iteration. Compare the area to previous iterations. Select the maximum area. The challenge is to go for the largest area.
* Increment the left pointer if the height value is less than the right height value. We're looking for the maximum. So, we're looking to increase the smaller value. 
* Increment the right pointer if the height value is less than the left height value. We're looking for the maximum. So, we're looking to increase the smaller value. 

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of the `height` list.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - A constant number of supporting variables.

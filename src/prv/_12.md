# Intuition

Use a mapping between Roman numerals and base 10 digits.

Subtract out larger values first.

# Approach

Use a local optimization "greedy" approach.

Create mapping of Roman numerals to base 10 digits.

Include two character mappings, "CM" = 900, for example.

Loop through the Roman numerals, largest values first.

Subtract out each Roman numeral value as many times as possible.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - A linear number based on the Roman numeral conversion rules.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - A constant number of supporting variables.

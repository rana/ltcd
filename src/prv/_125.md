# Two Pointers | Comments | ChatGPT 4 | 0ms

# Intuition

Comparing each end of an array can be done with two pointers.

Transform the given string to be able to test for character equality.

# Approach

Preprocess characters.

Compare front characters to back characters.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
    - One loop to transform characters, one loop to compare elements.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - A constant number of supporting variables.

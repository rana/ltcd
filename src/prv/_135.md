# Intuition

Observe that each child has at least one candy.

Observe that each higher rating receives more candy.

Consider higher rating on the left side.

Consider higher rating on the right side.

# Approach

Use a local optimization "greedy" approach.

Two passes through the ratings. 

One pass to address left relations.

One pass to address right relations.

Compute the sum in the second loop to use cache locality the candy count.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of the `ratings` array.
    - Two passes, O(2n) reduces to O(n) as coefficients drop.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - A constant number of supporting variables are used.

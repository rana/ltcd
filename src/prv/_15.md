# Two Pointers | Sorting | Comments | ChatGPT 4 | 24ms

# Intuition

Notice that the challenge constraints don't mention whether the array is sorted, or whether there are any duplicates. We can assume that the array is likely unsorted, and may have duplicates. We will need to sort and be aware of skipping any duplicates.

The challenge is similar to the sum of two values, which uses two pointers. In this challenge, we simply have a third pointer.

# Approach

Sort the `nums` array. We can't assume it is sorted. 

We'll rely on the array's sorting to use the two-pointer technique, and skip any duplicate values.

Create a for loop iterating through the `nums` array. This loop has one pointer.

Check for any duplicate value, and skip over if necessary.

Create an inner while loop using two additional pointers.

Initialize a left pointer to the front of the `nums` array.

Initialize a right pointer to the back of the `nums` array.

Look for three values which sum to zero.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n^2)`
    - `O(n^2)` due to having to an inner loop and outer loop which scans through the `nums` array.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - A constant number of supporting variables.

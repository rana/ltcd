# Intuition

Using the reversing approach seems most straight-forward to understand and implement.

From the editorial `k = 3`:
```
Original List                   : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
After reversing all numbers     : 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
After reversing first k numbers : 5 6 7 4 3 2 1
After revering last n-k numbers : 5 6 7 1 2 3 4
```

# Approach

Write a reverse function.

Reverse the whole array.

Reverse the array from front to `k`.

Reverse the array from `n-k` to end.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - Three calls to reverse iterate over the length of `nums` twice.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - A constant number of supporting variables.

# Intuition

Use HashMaps to map characters.

Check for reflexive mappings.

# Approach

Create a HashMap `s_to_t` with a key of character `s` and value of character `t`.

Create a HashMap of `t_to_s`. Character mapping is the inverse.

Loop through each string simultaneously:
    * If empty: insert char.
    * If set: check for reflexive mapping.
        - Return false if not reflexive mapping in either.

Return true after loop.

Create a HashMap with a perfect hash of the character's digit value. Possible due to the constraint of using the 128 ASCII characters.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of strings `s` and `t`, which are equal lengths.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - A constant number of variables.
    - Constrained by using 128 ASCII characters for HashMaps.

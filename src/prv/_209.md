# Sliding Window | Two Pointers | Comments | ChatGPT 4 | 0ms

# Intuition

Searching for a subarray with some condition can be solved with a sliding window and the two-pointer technique.

# Approach

Use sliding window and two-pointer technique.

Create a for loop which iterates through the nums array.

The for loop contains a right pointer.

Accumulate a rolling sum.

Check whether the sum is greater than, or equal to the target value.

Then attempt to shrink the left side of the window.

Continue looking for smaller windows.

After searching the whole array, return the smallest window or zero.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - A constant number of supporting variables.

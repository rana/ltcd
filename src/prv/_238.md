# Intuition

First observation would be to create a product of the entire array and divide out an element. 

Since that's not possible, due to the challenge's instructions, another approach is needed.

Creating a product of everything to the left of an element, then creating a product of everything to the right of an element is an approach.

# Approach

Loop through nums for a left product.

Loop through nums for a right product.

Each loop skips the current element in the product calculation.

Use the same, single return array for calculations.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - Two loops through `nums` array.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - Constant number of supporting variables.

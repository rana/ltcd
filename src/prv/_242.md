# HashMap | Perfect Hash | Comments | ChatGPT 4 | 0ms

# Intuition

Count the character frequencies in each word.

# Approach

Check whether strings have equal lengths. An anagram only has strings of equal lengths.

Use a single HashMap. 

Increment the character frequency from string `s`.

Decrement the character frequency from string `t`.

If a character frequency is below zero, return false.

Use an array as a map with a perfect hash function of subtracting character 'a' as the key. This is possible due to the use of lowercase English letters.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of string `s` and string `t`.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - The size of the HashMap is constant due to 26 lowercase letters used.

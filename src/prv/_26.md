# Intuition

Notice that we have a single array that is sorted.

Move unique elements from the back of the array to the front of the array.

Any duplicate elements would be clustered in a sub-array due to the sorting. We can use two pointers to look for duplicates.

Moving an element involves a source index and a destination index. Moving elements within a single array suggests two pointers.

# Approach

Initialize two pointers to the front of the array. Initialize `lft` to index zero. Initialize `rht` to index one.

Search for an element on the right side that can move left; that is an element which is different than the left side.

If we find a movable element, move it to one above the `lft` pointer position.

Don't be concerned for the element at the `rht` pointer position.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
  - `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
  - Allocates a couple integer variables.

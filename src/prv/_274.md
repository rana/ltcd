# Intuition

This relies on the citations index being sorted.

Then check for a condition where the citation count `>=` to the index position.

Track the max.

# Approach

Sort citations with a library function.

Loop through the `citations` array.

Look for the maximum value `citations[idx]` at a given index complying with the H-Index condition. 

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(nlogn)`
    - Sorting is O(nlogn). 
    - An additional O(n) to scan for the H-Index.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - A constant number of supporting variables.

# Two HashMaps | Comments | ChatGPT 4 | 0ms

# Intuition

Assure a one-to-one mapping by using two HashMaps.

One HashMap for char-to-word.

One Hashmap for word-to-char.

# Approach

Split the string into words.

Create HashMaps `chr_to_wrd` and `wrd_to_chr`.

Loop through the characters and words simultaneously.

If chr-wrd mapping doesn't exist, insert one. 

If chr-wrd mapping does exist, check whether the existing mapped word is what would currently be inserted. If not matched, return false.

Repeat steps for the wrd-chr mapping.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n + m)`
    - `n` is the length of string `s`.
    - `m` is the length of string `pattern`.
- Space complexity: `O(w)`
    - `w` is the number of words in string `s`.
    - For the character mapping, the 26 letters of the English alphabet is constant.

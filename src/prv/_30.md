# Intuition

We're looking for both a sequence of words as well as the frequency of a word within target string `s`. 

As we go through string `s`, we may encounter word sequences which are valid or invalid. As we traverse string `s` the observed substring may grow. A sliding window approach can help.

Frequency counting of words suggests using a HashMap.

We can rely on each word being the same length to advance through string `s` faster than starting at each character.

# Approach

HashMaps an a sliding window.

One HashMap tracks the frequency of the expected words.

Another HashMap tracks the frequency of observed words in the current window.

Loop through string `s` looking for a word permutation.

Use a sliding window approach.

If a whole substring is found, store the start index for return.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n * m)`
    - `n` is the length of string `s`.
    - `m` is the length of the array `words`.
- Space complexity: `O(m)`
    - `m` is the length of the array `words`.
    - We store frequency counts proportional to the number of words.

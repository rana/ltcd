# Two Pointers | Comments | ChatGPT 4 | 0ms

# Intuition

Use one pointer to traverse string `s`.

Use one pointer to traverse string `t`.

Compare `u8`s instead of four-byte `char`s.

# Approach

Traverse each string simultaneously.

We're looking for subsequence `s` in `t`.

Always advance the `t` pointer.

When a character matches from `s` in `t`, advance the `s` pointer.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(t)`
    - `t` is the length of the target string.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - A constant number of supporting variables.

# Intuition

Height of the left, space in the center, height of the right will be a factor. 

# Approach

A two-pointers technique is applied.

Track the left max value and the right max value.

Loop through the heights.

Look at the left side or right side.

For the left side, either update the left max value, or calculate the trapped rain water.

For the right side, either update the right max value, or calculate the trapped rain water.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of the `height` array.
- Space complexity: `O()`
    - A constant number of supporting variables are used.

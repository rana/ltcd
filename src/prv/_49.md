# HashMap | Sorting | Comments | ChatGPT 4 | 3ms

# Intuition

Use a HashMap.

Use a sorted string as a key.

Use a string array as the value.

# Approach

Create a HashMap.

Loop through each word.

Sort the characters of the word.

Insert the sorted_word-word mapping to the HashMap.

Return an array of the HashMap values.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(m * nlogn)`
    - `m` is the number of elements in array `strs`.
    - `nlogn` is the time to sort each word.
- Space complexity: `O(m * n)`
    - `m` is the number of elements in array `strs`.
    - `n` is the average length of a word.

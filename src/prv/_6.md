# String Preallocation | Comments | ChatGPT 4 | 0ms

# Intuition

Understand the end goal: transform character positions based row-column zig-zag logic.

# Approach

Use rows of strings to collect transformed strings.

Preallocate strings based on longest possible row string length.

Loop through each character in the string.

Add each character based on the zig-zag logic.

Return the row strings as a single string.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
    - `n` is the length of string `s`.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
    - A constant number of supporting variables are used.
